A package is an organizational unit for your ROS 2 code. 
If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then youâ€™ll need it organized in a package. 
With packages, you can release your ROS 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily.

Package creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. 
You can create a package using either CMake or Python, which are officially supported, though other build types do exist.

CMake package

CMakeLists.txt : file that describes how to build the code within the package
include/<package_name> : directory containing the public headers for the package
package.xml : file containing meta information about the package
src : directory containing the source code for the package

To make CMake package:

cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 <package_name>

Build package :

cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
