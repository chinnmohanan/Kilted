By default, ROS 2 communication is not limited to localhost. 
ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY environment variable allows you to limit ROS 2 communication to localhost only. 
This means your ROS 2 system, and its topics, services, and actions will not be visible to other computers on the local network. 
Using ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY is helpful in certain settings, such as classrooms, where multiple robots may publish to the same topic causing strange behaviors. 
You can set the environment variable with the following command:

Linux
    export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1  #Individual terminals wont communicate with other terminals in the same system.

If all terminals of a system has to communicate between them and restrict communication with other systems in same network, use:

    export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<value between 0 and 101 (both inclusive)>

By default all terminals have DOMAIN_ID=0.


To maintain this setting between shell sessions, you can add the command to your shell startup script:

    echo "export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1" >> ~/.bashrc
