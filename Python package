A package is an organizational unit for your ROS 2 code. 
If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then youâ€™ll need it organized in a package. 
With packages, you can release your ROS 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily.

Package creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. 
You can create a package using either CMake or Python, which are officially supported, though other build types do exist.

Python package

package.xml : file containing meta information about the package
resource/<package_name> : marker file for the package
setup.cfg : is required when a package has executables, so ros2 run can find them
setup.py : containing instructions for how to install the package
<package_name> : a directory with the same name as your package, used by ROS 2 tools to find your package, contains __init__.py

To make Python package:

cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license Apache-2.0 <package_name>

Build package :

cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build    OR
colcon build --packages-select my_package

To run the executable you created using the --node-name argument during package creation, enter the command:

ros2 run my_package my_node
